## Why Deploy Onchain?

Permanent, immutable deployments powered by blockchain technology.

### One Command Deploy

Deploy with a single npx command. Point to your build directory and deploy.

### Immutable & Permanent

Your app lives on the blockchain forever. No servers, no hosting fees, no downtime.

### Framework Agnostic

Works with React, Vue, Svelte, or vanilla JS. If it has an`index.html` file, you can deploy it.

## How It Works

Three simple steps to deploy.

1

### Build Your App

Run your normal build command to generate production files.

2

### Run Deploy Command

Execute `npx react-onchain deploy`

3

### Live on Blockchain

Your app is now permanently deployed. Share your onchain URL.

## What Can You Deploy?

Any static website or application.

### React Apps

Single page applications

### Vue & Svelte

Modern framework apps

### Static Sites

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Portfolios

Personal or professional sites

### Documentation

Project docs and wikis

### Landing Pages

Marketing pages

## Video Streaming Onchain

Stream videos directly from the blockchain. No servers, no middlemen—just pure decentralized content delivery.

### Instant Playback

Videos are chunked and stored onchain, enabling smooth streaming without downloading the entire file.

### Censorship Resistant

Once uploaded, your videos can never be taken down. They live permanently on the blockchain.

### No Size Limits

Stream videos of any size. Automatic chunking handles everything from short clips to feature-length films.

## Why Deploy Onchain?

See how React Onchain compares to traditional hosting platforms

| Feature | React Onchain | Vercel / Netlify | AWS / GCP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Monthly Hosting Cost | $0.0004\*<br>One-time only | $20-200+/mo | $50-500+/mo |
| Decentralized | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Censorship Resistant | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Permanent Storage | ✓<br>Forever onchain | ✗ | ✗ |
| Server Maintenance | None | Managed | Self-managed |
| Version History | Unlimited<br>On-chain forever | Platform dependent | Custom |
| You Own the Data | ✓<br>Immutable | ✗ | ✗ |

\\* One-time deployment cost for a typical 1MB app at current BSV prices. No recurring fees.

## Onchain Versioning & History

Every deployment is automatically versioned with unlimited history tracked directly on the blockchain.

### Automatic Versioning

Each deployment creates a new version inscription onchain. Track every release with version tags and descriptions.

`npx react-onchain version:history`

### Smart Caching

Unchanged files are automatically reused from previous deployments. Only pay for what actually changed.

## For the builders, the dreamers, and the decentralized future

This tool is dedicated to every developer who believes the web should be free, permanent, and owned by the people. To those who build not for profit, but for the principle that code, once written and deployed, should have the opportunity to live forever. And to all the believers in the original idea of Bitcoin—who never wavered, never compromised, and kept the path when others strayed.
